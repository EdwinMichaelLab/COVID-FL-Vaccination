COVID-FL-Vaccination
----------------
This repository stores the code, equations, and parameters associated with the Michael Group SEIR multi-variant model with vaccination, applied to the State of Florida.

# Project Guide
## Data Sources
1. [Coronavirus.app](https://coronavirus.app/tracking/florida) - daily confirmed case, death, and vaccination data.
2. [The Helix COVID-19 Surveillance Dashboard](https://www.helix.com/pages/helix-covid-19-surveillance-dashboard) - Alpha and Delta variant proportions over time.
3. [Unacast Covid-19 Social Distancing Scoreboard](https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard) - GPS Mobility Data in Florida, used to inform lockdown measures.
4. [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-03-01%202021-10-25&geo=US-FL&q=covid) - Google Trends query information, used to inform social distancing measures.

## Fitting and running the base scenario
The repository comes with Florida's daily case, death, and vaccination data up to
September 24th, which can be found in `Florida.csv`. The base scenario is run via the script `Main.m`:

`matlab -nodisplay -nosplash < Main.m`

This will produce output `Florida.mat`, which contains the predictions of all
state functions until the end of the year. With this file loaded, you can plot
median proportion of people immune using the following code:

`plot(median(V+B+R2, 2));`

Other state functions can be visualized similarly.

## Running alternative social measure / vaccination scenarios

After running the base fit, we can run various mitigation strategies going into the future. To do this, load `final_Florida.mat` which contains the state of the simulation at the end of the fitting window.
To simulate a full release of social measures, add `d = 1` to `diff_eqn1.m`, just before the definitions of the differential
equations.

To increase/decrease the vaccination rate, adjust line 444 in
`BM_SEIR_model.m`. For instance, to double the vaccination rate
going forward:

`totalv = 1.5*mean(Vaccinated(end-7:end));`

This would apply 1.5 times the average daily vaccination rate over the
last 21 days.

# Extended SEIR Model
In this study, we simulated the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the State of Florida using a variation of an SEIR model described in detail in Newcomb and colleagues (1). The Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describing the model are given fully below in the next section. Briefly, we assume Florida is a closed population and ignore demographic changes such that the total population size remains constant. The population is divided into compartments representing various infection stages: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious asymptomatic (IA), infectious pre-symptomatic (IP), infectious with mild symptoms (IM), infectious with severe symptoms requiring hospitalization (IH), infectious with severe symptoms requiring intensive care including ventilation (IC), recovered and immune (R), first-dose vaccinated (V), completely vaccinated (B), waned-immunity (W) and deceased (D). We further consider that a fraction (conservatively set at 10%) of the susceptible population, S, will refuse vaccinations, and we simply move this fraction to a new class (S2) that otherwise behave like S.

The specific transitions and rate parameters governing the evolution of the system, along with their prior and posterior fitted values, are described in the Table. The strength of social distancing measures as a result of public health policies to limit contacts is captured through the estimation of a scaling factor, d, which is in turn multiplied by the transmission rate, beta, to obtain the population-level transmission intensity operational at any given time in each population. This factor accounts for the transmission modifying effects of mask wearing, reductions in mobility and mixing, work from home, and any other deviations from the normal social behavior of each population prior to the epidemic.

The vaccination data for Florida is directly applied by moving the proportion of the population that is vaccinated over a 10- day block from the S class to the V (1st dose) class. Individuals then move from the V to the B (2nd dose booster) class at a daily rate approximating a 21 day interval between vaccine doses. Average vaccination rates estimated from the last week of vaccination data (Sept. 17 - Sept. 24, 2021) were used to simulate into the future. The future impacts of changes in social mitigation interventions and vaccination rates are simulated by altering the values of d and the vaccination rate.
